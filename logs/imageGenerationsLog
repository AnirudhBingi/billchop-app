I think we got to fix it. "Add income" is for individual, nothing related to shared. It's a personal stuff, so the add income page should show what's the income? what's the income source? (part-time, job, freelance money from home, family etc.) and that should be saved to the user's personal income stuff.  You can maybe rename the quick action card from "Add income" to something like "Personal" or anything else, I'm not sure what to name it. Can you please do your research and name it a better thing. Once I click on it, the user should have two forms: one add income and one is at expense form that's only for the personal stuff of the user.

We gotta rename that to the expense whatever it is like come up with a good term.

Now let's enhance this page.  Okay, so now we have "Who are you splitting with?"  <ul>  <li>Individual friends</li>  <li>Roommate group</li>  </ul>  Let's rename that to a simple group. Don't name it as roommate group or something. Let's come to individual friends. What did you spend on? Etc. Amount and then comes the category. I have told you initially as well I want the category section to be automatically selected when the user types in the section of what did you spend on? For eg. Fruits comes under groceries. For eg. Tools - a spanner or a screwdriver comes under tools. So similarly I want you to do that for me. Category should be automatically selected when the user types in the field of what did you spend on. Like if I spent on Liquor or a beer, it should categorize itself. Select the category itself. Same should be in the group section too. And I don't see a differentiation as of now between selecting individual friends and a roommate group. They both show similar, but I see a select group I can at the bottom of the page. Let's work on that.

I dont want you to create a clone of splitwise, i want you to create features that make out app stand apart. So please keep that in check, lets not go back and forth. First create a vision for yourself and start working. Remember user experience is top priority. We are missing so many features like attach receipt, and something like reading the receipt and automatically add up the total. Once user uploads a receipt, the review receipt should help user select items to split with or not. Few items should be split, and few shouldn’t for example. And same in group. Everything synced where needed. History,analytics, insights.
