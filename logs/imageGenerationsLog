And these two are related to shared expense."\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/54EC8729-FE96-4D64-A64A-5A98810681E4.jpg\n\n[2025-07-12T05:47:19.304Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "When I clicked on the "Add income from quick actions" button, it opened an "Add expense" tab which is empty. I think we got to fix it. "Add income" is for individual, nothing related to shared. It's a personal stuff, so the add income page should show what's the income? what's the income source? (part-time, job, freelance money from home, family etc.) and that should be saved to the user's personal income stuff.  You can maybe rename the quick action card from "Add income" to something like "Personal" or anything else, I'm not sure what to name it. Can you please do your research and name it a better thing. Once I click on it, the user should have two forms: one add income and one is at expense form that's only for the personal stuff of the user.

At the bottom of the page, we have dashboard expenses. Choose personal and profile. Let's work on expenses. I don't like the word expenses down there in the bottom navigation. Let's use some advanced or try to think of a new word that that tab opens the shared expense something like SplitWise. That's how it should work, the expense tab.  We gotta rename that to the expense whatever it is like come up with a good term. And when I click on the expenses tab, I should have the recent expenses, the shared expenses with which friend, which group it should differentiate. And then we have the add button at the top, that's works fine. Let's build this.

I'm really confused. Like, you know, the SplitWise app has the friends page. Let me give you the friend speech screenshot first. Please look at this carefully. I'll provide 4-5 screenshots of SplitWise and how its speech looks and how its functions are first check that, and then let's start working on our app. Thats only one screenshot. I will give few more wait for me"\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/93A45744-6B1C-4346-83AE-3A11F7225D89.jpg\n\n
